# Building and Testing

Foreman consists of two main packages, [foreman-go](https://github.com/cybergarage/foreman-go) and [foreman-cc](https://github.com/cybergarage/foreman-cc). The former is a main package of Foreman which is written by Go, and the latter is a core library of Foreman which is written by C++.

To build Foreman, you have to install [foreman-cc](https://github.com/cybergarage/foreman-cc) at first because 
[foreman-go](https://github.com/cybergarage/foreman-go) is depended on [foreman-cc](https://github.com/cybergarage/foreman-cc).
